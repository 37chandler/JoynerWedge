Did you write some reflections somewhere other than the Submissions.md file? 

Sucks that in part 1 you had to specify the full schema. That's annoying. Everything looks good though. 

Part 2 looks good as well. You include the query that does the random sampling, though you don't actually need it since you make it a subquery when you actually pull data.

In Part 3, you're working *really* hard to avoid doing a join, by writing `dept_name`. Just do the join! I love how terse the pandas code is, though. 

I'd like to read some prose reflections, but otherwise you can call this complete. I'll add you to the solutions repo. Clone that sooner rather than later because I'll probably revoke access sometime after the semester ends. Nice work!
